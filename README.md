Introduction:

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks focused on the analysis of burn data:

1. burn_binary.ipynb: Binary classification analysis.
2. burn_multiclass.ipynb: Multiclass classification analysis.

---

Instructions to Run the Notebooks:

1. Environment Setup:
    - Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
    - It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage the dependencies.
    - Install the required libraries as seen at the beginning of each notebook. For example:
        ```
        pip install pandas numpy matplotlib ydata_profiling scikit-learn xgboost shap
        ```

2. Data Setup:
    - While the data is deidentified, it is protected under an IRB and cannot be shared, however, I have provided a data profile html for exploratory data analysis. I am happy to run the code in person during office hours to demonstrate reproducibility. 
 

3. Running the Notebooks:
    - Open the desired notebook in Jupyter.
    - Run each cell sequentially from top to bottom.
    - Note: Some cells, particularly those involving profiling reports, are commented out and might require large computational resources. Uncomment and run them if needed.

4. Displays
    - _display files contain an html of the code with outputs for reference

Additional Notes:

- Ensure that you have all the required libraries installed, especially `ydata_profiling` and `shap` which are not as common as the others.
- The notebooks have been designed to provide insights into the burn data. For specific explanations on each step or code cell, refer to the comments and markdown cells within the notebooks.
- If you encounter any issues or require further explanations, please let me know
